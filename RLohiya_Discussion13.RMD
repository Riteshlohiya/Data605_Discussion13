Using R, provide the solution for any exercise in either Chapter 4 or Chapter 7 of the calculus textbook.  If you are unsure of your solution, post your concerns.

# Chapter 4.3 Exercise 4:

```{r}
library(Deriv)
```

Find the minimum sum of two numbers whose product is 500.

limx -> 0  - f(x) = - $infinity$

```{r}
mav <- 100
miv <- -mav

fx <- function(x) {
    x + 500/x
}
fxprime <- Deriv(fx)
(out_root <- uniroot(fx, c(miv, mav)))
```
